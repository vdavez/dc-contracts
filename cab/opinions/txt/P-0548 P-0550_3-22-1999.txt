        These consolidated protests challenge a solicitation and subsequent contract awards foi loof
replacement at vai ions District public school buildings J&R ai gues that the solicitation had a numbei of
ambiguities that should have been clarified by the piocm ing agency, the District of Columbia Public Schools
("DCPS"), through solicitation amendments prior to bid opening J&R also piotests the contiact awaids
which were made by the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance
Aulhonty ("Authority") on the ground that J&R, not the awaidees, were the low, icsponsive, and
responsible bidder under seven of eight awaid groups defined by the solicitation Although the Disti ict
challenges our jurisdiction over the protests because the Authoiity awaided the contiacts, we conclude that
these protests are subject to the Procurement Practices Act and our protest jurisdiction On the mei its,
we conclude that DCPS's responses or failures to lespond to J&R's clarification icquests do not wan ant
sustaining the solicitation protest In addition, we conclude that J&R's piotest of the awaids is without
ment Accordingly, we deny both protests

                                           BACKGROUND

        On April 15,1998, the District of ColumbiaPubhc Schools ("DCPS") issued SohcitationNo
DCPS-l-98022-OC, entitled "Design-Build Roof Replacement FY98," to potential bidders for roof
i eplacement at various public school buildings (Agency Repoi I ("AR"), Ex 1) Besides issuing the IFB,

Under the "AWARD" section on the cover page, it is stated that awai d is "to be completed by the District
of Columbia Public Schools" and executed by a conli acting officer on behalf of DCPS (AREx 1)
Section A 1 of the solicitation provides the following statement of intent

        and i emain free of unreasonable failure and defects thi oughout its intended life span The
        work includes, but is not necessarily limited to, construction of loofs for various schools
        located in the District of Columbia as identified herein

Section A 2 specified that the resulting conti act would be a fn m-lixed-pi ice type contract The solicitation

The clause provides that the contractor may appeal the CEO/Supei mtendent's decision to the Contract
Appeals Board Section M 1 provides that DCPS will evaluate bids, will make awards, and may i eject
bids and waive informalities or minor 11 regularities in bids

        In the specifications, entitled "Design-Build Project Requirements," DCPS is repeatedly identified
as the contracting agency with responsibility for contracting, design i eview, inspection, and payment
authority (AR Ex 1, Vol 2) In Section 111, Part 1, Item 1.2, the specification states that "All questions
concerning bid submissions shall be directed to the DCPS Contracting Officer in wilting."

        The information provided in the attached scopes of work and sketches is based on field
        observations and accessibility to loof aieas at the time and is intended to be repiesenlative
        of the existing conditions The documents in Appendix A are not design documents It is
        the Contractor's responsibility to confirm existing conditions and verily quantities and
        dimensions in the bids and eventually prepaie design documents for approval by DCPS

        DCPS issued Amendment 1 of the solicitation on April 1,7,1998, Amendment 2 on April 24,1998,
and Amendment 3 on April 29,1998 (AR Ex 2, Tabs 1 -3) Amendment 4, issued by DCPS on May 1,
1998, states that the "DCPS Contracting Officei forthispiojectisMi Paul Ross " (AR Ex. 2, Tab 4, at
6 (Section 01010, Part 1, Item 1 2 B)) Attached to Amendment 4 was a 7-page DCPS document dated
May 1,1998, responding to prospective contiactois' questions icgaiding the solicitation Wilhiegaidlo
one bidder's.observation that dimensions in diawmgs piovidcd by DCPS diffcicd Horn actual dimensions
measuied by the bidder in the field, and that the bidder intended to "bid per plans and specifications,"
DCPS lephed "This is a Design/Build contiact The loof diagiams attached to the bid documents must
be field verified " (AR Ex. 2, Tab 4) DCPS issued Amendment 5 on May 2,1998, and Amendment 6
on May 9, 1998 (AR Ex 2, Tabs 1-6)

         Bids from 17 bidders weie opened on May 14, 1998, by DCPS DCPS oveisaw bid opening
with assistance fiom the Corps of Engineeis, DCPS leviewed the bids at bid opening, DCPS evaluated
bids, and DCPS piepared the bid tabulation, all with assistance from the Corps of Engineeis (AR Ex 4
(Ross Aff 1| 2)) Alter DCPS evaluated the bids, it would have been customary for the DCPS contiacting
officer to noti ry the successful bidders of their awards and provide notices to proceed with work That did
not happen here Rather, in a manner similar to that desci ibed in another DCPS protest, A L Eastmond
c&Som,CABNo P-551,Sept 9,1998, 45 D C Reg 8826, 8830, a icpiesentative on behalf of the
Authonty awarded the contracts to the successful biddeis In making the awards, the Authoi ity made
several changes to each successful bidder's bid cover page', First, the heading "District of Columbia Public
Schools" which appealedjust above the title "Solicitation, Offei, and Awai d for Supplies and/or Sei vices"
on the original solicitation cover sheet, was crossed out Second, the block on the form indicating that
DCPS had issued the solicitation was modified by adding the following information

        Assistance Authority (DCFRA)

Thiid, the line at the bottom ofthe form which originally lead "Award (To be completed by the Disti ict of
Columbia Public Schools)" was annotated by replacing "Distnct of Columbia Public Schools" with
"DCFRA." Fourth, the contract number was prefixed with "DCFRA " Finally, the contracting officer's
signature block was changed by leplacing the "District of Columbia Public Schools" heading with "DC

                                              DISCUSSION

        Jurisdiction

         The Dish ict states that the Aulhoi ily has taken ovei the i oof replacement proem ement and that it,
not DCPS, awaided the contiacls to the successful biddcis According to the District, because the
Authority awarded the contracts, and the Board lacks authority to consider protests of awaids by the
Authority, the Boaid must dismiss>the protests J&R aigues that the Aulhoiity's power to enter into
conti acts pursuant to section 103 of Public Law No 104-8, the Act which established the Authonty, is not
applicable to the DCPS solicitation here, wheie the solicitation was issued and conducted by and foi
DCPS, and contract performance will be admimsteied and funded by DCPS Thisjunsdictional issue is
essentially the same as that raised and decided by us in an earlier pi otest,y4 L Eastmond&Som, CAB
No P-551,Sept. 9,1998,45DC Reg 8826. A s m ^ L Easlmond, all aspects of the solicitation and
proem ement leading up to award were conducted by the DCPS contracting officer At the time DCPS
issued the solicitation, the Procurement Reform Amendment Act of 1996, D C Law 11 -259, made DCPS
piocuiements subject to the Procuiemenl Practices Act, D C Code § 1-1181 4(a) (Supp 1998), and
protests of those proem ements subject to Board jurisdiction, id § 1-1189 3(a)-(b) All six solicitation
amendments were issued by DCPS, the last one issued only days befoie bid opening The solicitation and
amendments, including the protest pi ocedu res incorporated by operation of law in DCPS proem ements,
                                                                                                               [7689]

make clear thai the solicitation and any award under the solicitation was subject to the Board's piotest
juusdiclion As in ,4 L Eastmond, the Authority did not issue any solicitation amendment taking contiol
ovei the piocmement or eliminating protest rights of bidders. Nor did the Authority suggest that it intended
to deprive bidders of their protest i ighls when it executed the contracts on behalf of DCPS Theiefoie,
based on the record piesented to us, it is clear that Board protest jurisdiction was intended and never
i evoked and we properly exercise jurisdiction puisuant to D C Code § 1-1189 3 (Supp 1998)

        The Solicitation Protest

       J&R challenges a number of solicitation provisions and failuies of DCPS to clanfy We address
them seuatim

         The fh st issue relates to a DCPS tesponse to a question submitted by J&R dm ing the bid phase
Attached to Amendment No 4, dated May 1,1998, were 7 pages of answers to questions submitted by
vauous prospective biddeis (AR Ex 2, Tab 4) In its-Question 11, J&R stated that a specified one-
quarter inch per foot taper insulation, when installed, "will bury the existing through wall flashing " J&R
states that "industry standards do not permit installing the specified counter-flashing eight inches above it"
as indicated on specification page 07620-11 (Pail 3.2), Item N J&R asked for a collected design
parametei In the same question, J&R also asked whether the tapered insulation could be omitted based
on manufactmer warranties as in prior years DCPS's response was. "Contractor will design the loof
system to comply with the owners guide specifications and the recommendations of the manufactuiers'
icpiesentative " We have leviewed the specification piovisions and the question and answer The recoi cl
does not demonstrate an irreconcilable conflict between the DCPS guide specifications and mdustiy
standards 01 manufacturer's lecommendations

           J&Raigues that for Hyde Elementary School, Section III (Scope of Woik), Items C 4 and D 5
(both of which state "Install flashing around doimei window"), aie unclear concerning whethei DCPS "is
i efei i ing to the facade at the south dormer only 01 the flashing only behind the horizontal wings " We agree
with the District that these piovisions are sufficiently clear

         J&R challenges language in Amendment No 4, page 2, paragiaph n , which slates "Hyde ES,
page 3, Add Alternale 1 subparagraph AA1, DELETE, Ihe word East and insert, South " It is cleai that
this entire reference is in error because there was no subpai agiaph AA1 or "Add Alternate 1" in the Scope
of Work for Hyde Elementary School and Amendment No 4 deleted the "Add Alternate" paragraph fiom
the original bid form Thus, the proposed change lo delele "east" and inserl "south" was hsled in error
This allempled change lo a nonexislenl specificalion lepresenls a minor enoi in Ihe sohcilalion and had no
effecl on Ihe abilily of firms to submit a bid for Ihis school J&R does not indicate in the protesl record lhal
il ever raised Ihis issue with DCPS prior lo submitting its May 14,vl998 protest letler lo DCPS

        Also wilh regard lo Ihe Hyde Elemenlary School scope of work, J&R argues lhal Ihe woi d "seal"
in Ilem B 7 (B 7 slates' "Inslall slepped wall counter flashing al the chimneys Seal top and all joints ") is
ambiguous and might mean either repoinling the chimney .brick with mortal or sealing by caulking We
                                                                                                                      [7690]

agiee with the District that under customary tiade usage, the work "seal" refers to using a sealant and that
loofing contractors would understand this term and its customary trade usage Because scopes of woik
for other schools in the solicitation explicitly call for repoinling brick with mortar, the solicitation as a whole
confnms the meaning intended in B 7 of Hyde's scope of woik J&R does not indicate in the piotest
iccoi d that it ever raised this issue with DCPS pi lor to submitting its May 14,1998 pi otest letter to DCPS

         J&R states that, for Hyde Elementary School, Roofs A, D, and C weie flat seam metal i oofs on
the building but the scope of work (e g , Item A 1) called for standing seam metal roofs on felt substrate
Stating that Roof A is too flat for installation of standing seam, and Roofs C and D are flat at the top, J R
stated that it needed to know whether standing seam was icquested in all aieas 01 only in the sloped aieas
The District responds that under a design/build contract such as this one, the contractor was expected to
use customaiy trade practice in assessing the exact areas foi use of standing seam We agiee with J&R
that DCPS should have lesponded to this question, but we conclude that DCPS's failuie did not pi event
J&R and the other bidders from making a reasonable estimate for a design/build bid J&R does not
indicate in the record that it raised this issue with DCPS prior to its May 14,1998 protest letter to DCPS

          In its May 14 protest letter, J&R aigued that various bid forms contained errors pertaining to i oof
elevations J&R now concedes that those errors were collected by Amendment No 6, but maintains that
the corrections were made only three days before bid opening and caused confusion in bid preparation
J&R may be correct that it caused confusion Undoubtedly, DCPS should have corrected the enors as
eai ly in the bid piocess as possible in oidei to obtain the most accurate bids possible. Nevertheless, we
are not convinced that the errors were so subtle as to prevent competent bidders from pi opei ly estimating
the individual projects

       J&R complains that the bid form foi Eaton Elemental y School identifies "Johnson Elemental y
School" in one place on the last page We believe that when the bid form is read in its entirely, thei e is no
leasonable question as to which school is concerned

         J&R states that it sought additional information concerning the roof removal process over conci ete
Substiates where bitumen fi om pievious roof installation is often found adhered to the deck J&R asked
whether the remaining residue of bitumen that adhered to the substiate would be allowed to lemam or
whether it would have to sand, chipand scrape the conci ete substrates The District responds that no
further answer is necessary because a contractor pei forming looting replacement should be familial with
the residue standards consistent with customary trade practice and the roofing manufacturer's requirements
necessary to ictain the manufacturer's warranty J&R has not shown any conflict between customaiy trade
piactice and DCPS's guideline specifications Thus, we do not find merit in J&R's complaint
                                                <
         J&R states that it had an unresolved question concerning the project requirements found at page
07552-19, part 3 7 E, specifically whether walk pads were lequired around all exhaust fans. We believe
the requiiement reasonably answers that question It states "Walkway Pads1 Provide walkway pads fiom
roof hatches, access doors, and laddeis to roof mounted mechanical and electrical equipment using units
of manufactuier's standaid size
                                                                                                              [7691]

        J&R argues that it received no response to its question concerning whether thei e is a requirement
to have a full-time quality control inspector and/or project manager on each site J&R also states that it
requested but never received a description of .the specific scope of work for the quality control inspectoi
and/or pi oject manager We conclude that Amendment No 2 provided bidders sufficient information with
lespectto these questions Amendment No 2, paragiaph i, added section 01440 ("Contractor Quality
Control), which specifies in detail the lequired quality conttol personnel, and peiformance and
documentation requirements

        In its DCPS protest letter of May 14, 1998, J&R stated                                                   ',

        Several questions have been raised regarding omission of the specified one-quartei in
        (1/4") per foot slope for tapered insulation If during inspection of each school it is
        determined that one or more schools already have a 1 /4" per foot slope to the substrate,
        can the additional specified 1/4" per foot slope be omitted9 This question has been asked
        but has not been answered:                          '             ,

This essentially restates the first issue, which was addressed in Item 11 of J&R's questions in the May 1,
1998 DCPS lesponses to bidder questions The preamble to Part 2 5 ("Insulation Materials") at page
07552-11 states the contractor is to "[p]rovide pieformed, roofing insulation boards that comply with
requirements, selected fiom manufacturer's standard sizes and of thicknesses indicated, appioved by
loofing membiane manufacturer for loofing membiane system             Provide preformed, tapered insulation
boards wheie indicated for sloping to drain. Fabricate with the following taper 4 a 1/4 inch minimum per

provided adequate information to a roofing bidder.

        Regarding the requirement for free flow drainage, 'J&R states that it asked DCPS for any
information available on blockages or breakages within the existing rain leader systems but leceived no
answer The Distt ict1 responds that the scopes of work (section C) contained all available information for
individual schools In reply, J&R states on information and belief that theie was a broken storm watei pipe
below slab at Stuart Hobson School which was not disclosed by DCPS. Cleai ly, a bidder prepai es its bid
based on what is disclosed and is reasonably discoverable through pre-bid inspection based upon the
cncumstances. Undisclosed and hidden defects are resolved through the Changes and Differing Site                >
Conditions clauses during performance Accordingly, we find no merit in J&R's argument

         With regard to J&R's question regarding whether the asbestos removal contractor might also act
as the "Qualified Assessment Fnm" mentioned in Part II-3-3, Section 21 1, we agiee with the Disti ict that
the solicitation did not require that the asbestos removal contractor and the qualified assessment firm be
different entities and therefore no.'further DCPS response was required

        J&R states that it sought a contractual definition for masonry damage but received no i espouse
We believe that in the absence of a DCPS definition, the contractor would interpret those terms accoidmg
to customary trade usage

         Concerning the scopes of work which stale, for example, "repair damaged i oof mounted fixtui es,
including security lighting, conduits, and public address system and make operable," J&R sought
information fiom DCPS identifying the specific problems with the fixtures and how to make them operable
In the DCPS question and answer i espouses of May 1,1998, D<CPS responded "Bid on what is available
                                                                                                                      >\
in the specification with the understanding that items mentioned must be made operable " We are satisfied
that from the scopes of work and their pre-bid surveys and investigations, bidders were able to formulate
a bid on the roof mounted fixtures

        Finally, J&R argues that the reqimemenl of a minimum eight inch height above the roof membi ane
foi base Hashing, found at page 07552-20, parl 3 8 B, is impossible to meet due to the existing Ihiough-
wall metal flashing height J&R states that it received no icsponse to a request for guidance However,
a leview of pail 3 8 indicates thai Ihe conliacl is to install Hashing according to the looting system
manufacluier's written instructions and the specified requirements J&R has nol shown any mil insic conilicl
belween Ihe flashing requirements and Ihe roofing syslem manufacturer's wntlen instructions

        The Protest of the Awards

         J&R ai gues thai no bidder other than J&R submitted either a fully executed lax cei lificalion affidavil
as icquired by Section J of the solicitation, or Ihe forms and other material required by the affidavit The
Dislnct correctly noles lhal submitting the tax certification affidavit is a matter of responsibility, not
responsiveness, which can be conecled pi 101 lo awaid C&D Tt ee Service, CAB No P-295, Nov 2,
1993,41 DC Reg 3691,3698 In icply, J&R argues vaguely that "cei tain licensing documentation uses
to a definitive cnlena of responsibility " J&R ens on bolh counts Thus, we icject this ground of piolesl

         J&R argues lhal Ihe bids of Roofers, Inc , and several other bidders, were untimely because the
bids weie received by DCPS after 3 p. m onMay 14,1998. The District responds lhat Amendments 5
and 6 changed the bid opening time from 3pm to 4 p m. and the bids were received prior to 4 p m and
are thus limely J&R replies that "bid closing lime was eslablished as 3 p m and was never changed" and
that the "only thing thai AmendmenlNo 6 changed was Ihe bid opening dale fiom May 11 lo may 14 "
We do not agree. Amendment ^Jo 5slalesinperlmenlpail "The closing dale and lime of opening foi
subjeqt solicitation is hereby extended fiom May 6, 1998, opening time 3 00 P M EST to May 11,
opening time 4:00 p.m. EST " Amendment No 6slales "The closing date and time of opening for
subject sohcilalion is hereby exlended fiom'May 11,1998, lo May 14,1998 " Thus, Amendment No
6 modified the bid opening from May 11,1998, at 4 p m , to May 14,1998, at 4 p m No amendment
ever changed bid opening lime back lo 3 p m Contrary lo implication made by J&R, neither the
sohcitalion noi Ihe amendments established a diffeient time foi "bid closing" and "bid opening " Rathei,
the solicitation and amendments refer lo Ihe "closing dale" and Ihe "lime of [bid] opening " Thus, bids were
due by the time of bid opening oh the closing dale

             argues that it was the low, responsive, and responsible bidder under Award Gioup 1, by
challenging the lower bids of seven other biddeis undei that award group With regaid to MTI, the
awaidee under Award Group 1, J&R alleges that MTI 'Tailed to include reference to having any expei lence
with bitumen i oofing systems," "failed to provide a clear desci iption of how work assignments iclate to
schools in the Group packages as required by the specifications," and "failed to provide the required
engmeei's letter in connection with the Hyde Elementary School portion of the work " As the Disti ict
conectly responds, these matters are not matters of responsiveness and do not merit rejection of MTI's
bid This also resolves J&R's challenge of the award made to MTI under Award Group 7

         J&R aigues that it was the low, responsive, and icsponsible bidder under Award Group 2, by
challenging the lower bids of six othei bidders under that award group With regard to Roofeis, Inc , the
awaidee undei Award Group 2, J&R alleges that Roofers "failed to submit a photocopy of the license of
a professional engineer or architect, a definitive criteria of responsibility," and "resti icted and thei efoi e
impi operly qualified its bid by limiting its scope of woi k to what Roofers charactei ized as its 'pi actical ,
approach' instead of performing what is required under the specifications " As the District correctly
responds, the license is a'matter of responsibility, that may be corrected prior to contract award Although
Section M 1 5, added by Amendment No. 2, states that bids omitting the license "will be considered non-
lesponsive" that language does not convert what it clearly a matter of responsibility into one of
lesponsiveness See, eg, C&D Tree Service, 41 DC Reg at 3699-3700. Concerning the alleged
qualification of Roofers' bid, we agree with the District that the reference to the "practical appioach" was
consistent with the requnements of this design/build contiact which required bidders to use the scope of
woi k as a guideline in developing a design that would meet the stated pei formance requirements Thus,
we conclude that the language in Roofers' bid, when properly construed, does not amount to a qualification
of its bid This also resolves J&R's challenge of the award made to Roofers under Award Group 4.

       J&R argues that it was the low, responsive, and responsible bidder under Awaid Group 3, by
challenging the lower bids of four other bidders under that awaid group With icgaid to H R General
Maintenance Corp., the awardee under Award Group 3, J&R alleges that H R "failed to provide any
evidence of its subcontractor's experience " As the District conectly responds, this matter is not one of
responsiveness and does not merit rejection of II R 's bid

          J&R argues that it was the low, responsive, and responsible bidder under Award Group 6, by
challenging the lower bids of seven other bidders under that award gi oup With regai d to Bi othei s
Construction, the awardee under Award Group 6, J&R alleges that Brothers "lists no relevant expei lence
for itself or its subcontractors and no'specific woi k assignments as required under the specifications " As
the District correctly responds, these are matters of responsibility and contract administration, not of
responsiveness J&R cites no valid ground meriting rejection of Brothers' bid This also lesolves J&R's
challenge of the award made to Brothers under Award Group 8

        None of the grounds stated in J&R's award protest, CAB No P-550, have any ment
